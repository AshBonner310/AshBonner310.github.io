		<h2>From Mathematics to Soil Science</h2>
		  <p> After spending several years in graduate school studying Nonlinear Dynamics and other subjects, in 2022 I was given the opportunity to join the Todd-Brown lab and apply my research to the science of modeling soil carbon with a focus on how soil is modeled in earth systems models.
